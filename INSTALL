To install, simply run the following in this directory as root:

    python setup.py install
    
PyTyle is meant to run in the background, so run it like so:

    pytyle &
    
You may want to add the above command to your ~/.xinitrc or
another startup script.

After PyTyle has been executed for the first time, it will create a
configuration file in your XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pytyle/ directory (usually
~/.config/pytyle) called pytylerc. The comments in the configuration
file will explain everything.
