PyTyle is an extremely versatile and extensible tiling manager that is meant
to be embedded into EWMH window managers. Its feature set was modeled after
the basic tiling features of XMonad- even down to the key bindings.

It has been tested relatively well on OpenBox and partially on Fluxbox. It
should, in theory, work with any window manager complying with the EWMH
standards.
