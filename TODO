TODO LIST

Allow resizing of window in any arbitrary direction.

The "Cascade" layout needs attention. It's behavior is a bit weird.

Make sure windows don't get resized to less than 1x1

Look into drawing borders around windows when undecorated.

Look at abstracting the main tiling algorithms a bit more.

Add support for more window managers. Thankfully, I don't need to worry
about tiling window managers :-)

Add more tiling algorithms! (Ideas, anyone?)
