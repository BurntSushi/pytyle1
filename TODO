TODO LIST

Make all commands work when windows are maximized
    Alternatively- create a new "full screen" tiling
    algorithm. I like this better. (And thus remove
    the maximize/restore commands.)

Make sure windows don't get resized to less than 1x1

Look into drawing borders around windows when undecorated.

Look at abstracting the main tiling algorithms a bit more.

Add support for more window managers. (Compiz will be
a bit difficult.) Thankfully, I don't need to worry
about tiling window managers :-)

Add more tiling algorithms! (Ideas, anyone?)


BUG FIXES

For release 0.2

PyTyle now detect when the screen orientation changes.
(For instance, if you add or remove a screen.)
