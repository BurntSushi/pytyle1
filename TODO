TODO LIST

Make sure windows don't get resized to less than 1x1

Look into drawing borders around windows when undecorated.

Look at abstracting the main tiling algorithms a bit more.

Add support for more window managers. Thankfully, I don't need to worry
about tiling window managers :-)

Add more tiling algorithms! (Ideas, anyone?)
