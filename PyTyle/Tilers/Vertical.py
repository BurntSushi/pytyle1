"""
Vertical.py

The most basic and default tiling algorithm. It consists of a master pane
on the left, and keeps the slaves over to the right.

Remember that this class inherits _cycle, help_find_next, and help_find_previous
from TileDefault.

Note that if you're creating your own tiling algorithm, you *MUST* add
    CLASS = CLASS_NAME
at the bottom of your class definition file (see the bottom of this file
for an example). This is so tiling algorithms can be dynamically loaded.

    # I've been thinking about generalizing tiling algorithms even more. So this
    # approach could change a little in the future. (Although I imagine the class
    # hierarchy will be staying the same, I like it.)
