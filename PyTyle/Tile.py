Tile.py

Tile is the guts of the tiling algorithm. It actually does *most* of the heavy
lifting for you, as many of the tiling actions (i.e., the key bindings in the
configuration) aren't really relevant to the physical display of the windows.
(However, the class hierarchy is such that you could make them relevant, if you
wish.)

In fact, to create your own customized tiling algorithm, you need only overload
the following methods: _tile, _cycle, _master_increase, _master_decrease,
help_find_next, and help_find_previous. By default, Vertical and Horizontal are
so similar, that currently, _cycle, help_find_next, and help_find_previous are 
overloaded once in TileDefault (which cannot be used as a tiling algorithm by
itself), and _tile, _master_increase, and _master_decrease are each overloaded
accordingly in two of TileDefault's subclasses: Horizontal and Vertical.

To create your own tiling algorithm, read the comments in this file, along with
Tilers/TileDefault.py, Tilers/Horizontal.py, and Tilers/Vertical.py.

    # Also, in general, the following tiling methods are fairly generic (any method beginning
    # with an underscore). However, the class hierarchy is setup in such a way that does not 
    # preclude their customization. Simply overload whichever method that needs customizing
    # in your tiling class. (_tile, _cycle, _master_increase, _master_decrease should be
    # sufficient here. Along with the helper methods help_find_next and help_find_previous.)

    # The core of the tiling algorithm. This will be called whenever PyTyle senses
    # that a screen needs to be re-tiled. It is essentially the bread and butter of
    # your tiling algorithm. It is responsible for placing *all* masters and slaves
    # in the TileStorage on the screen (unless you desire other behavior, like a
    # limited number of windows, but the behavior could be unpredictable). See the

    # the window to the upper left coordinates of the screen. (Could be bad.) We
