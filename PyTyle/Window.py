Window.py

Serves as a layer between tiling and interfacing with the Probe. It also
provides the function to load a window into PyTyle.

Windows are actually kept in three different data structures: (I should
probably change this so that Screen and TileStorage simply point to
windows in State?)
    State
        The State class keeps track of all windows currently known by
        PyTyle. This includes hidden windows, but doesn't include things
        like popups.
    Screen
        Each Screen keeps a record of which windows are on its screen.
        This will include hidden windows.
    TileStorage
        Each screen has its own tiling algorithm, and each tiling
        algorithm has its own tiling storage. In this storage, all tiling
        windows are kept. This will *not* include hidden windows.

    # Note: This method also has logic to *skip* windows. Namely, it will
    # check to make sure that the window is in one of our stored desktops.

    # won't be tiled.
