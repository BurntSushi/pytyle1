Screen.py

The Screen class will handle all screen related functionality. For instance,
it provides methods to detect if a given window is on its screen. Also, it
will keep track of its state; like if it needs to be tiled, has tiling
enabled/disable, and of course, its current tiling algorithm.

    # *only* be enabled for tiling using a key binding tied to the tile method.

    # window. Be careful about that.
    #
    # Logic: The screen is in charge of reporting back an active window,
    # and also saying when there isn't one. There are four possibilities:
    #    1. If there is no active window set, and there are no windows, 
    #       then return nothing.
    #    2. If there are windows, and no active window, then arbitrarily
    #       select the first window in the screen window storage to make
    #       active. Also, if there are windows and the currently active window
    #       is no longer on this screen, then similarly choose an arbitrary
    #       window to make active.
    #    3. If there are no windows but there is an active window
    #       and it's no longer on the screen, then return nothing.
    #    4. Finally, if it's none of the above, then return the currently
    #       set active window.

    # back correctly, in a way that allows PyTyle to see where docks/panels are.
