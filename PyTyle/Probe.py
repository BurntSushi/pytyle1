Probe.py

This file, along with Event.py, are the only two classes *aware*
of X. This means the rest of PyTyle could be yanked out and used
in other projects (YaTWM, anyone?). It also means you could rip
out this PROBE class and use it elsewhere.

Probe is a library class using Xlib to query the currently running
window manager (and X) for information about desktops, screens, 
and windows.

This library includes everything from finding window sizes,
desktops, maximizing/restoring windows, to physical screen information
and a lot more.

    #        screen resolutions (struts).

    #       viewports, respectively.
