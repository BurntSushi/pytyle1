# KEY BINDINGS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key binding format:
# [Alt-][Shift-][Ctrl-][Super-]KEY
#
# Where you can use any combination of modifiers. And KEY is:
# 
# Any letter or number. There are also names for special keys.
#
# I don't have a complete listing yet. I'll put it here soon.
# In general, you can use pretty much any key, but it has 
# to be recognized by Xlib. (For instance, "comma" and not "," 
# and not "Comma" even.)
#
# If you need a list, check out your Python Xlib library,
# probably located somewhere like...
# /usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages/Xlib/keysymdef/
# Specifically, see "miscellany.py" and "latin1.py"
#
# Note: I haven't been able to get the F([1-9]|(1[0-2]) keys
# to work yet. (Although, I've only tried in OpenBox.)
#
# Note 2: If you've used XMonad, you'll feel right as rain!
# I started on Arch with XMonad, and moved to OpenBox,
# so naturally, the key bindings clone XMonad's.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DOCKS, PANELS, ETC...
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This will allow you to forcefully tell PyTyle about any docks/panels that
# you may have. If you have a basic setup (read: one screen), then I would
# advise that you ignore this for now, and only configure this if you notice
# that PyTyle is putting windows over your docks/panels.
#
# However, if you have two or more screens and have docks/panels, you *MUST*
# configure this, otherwise PyTyle will use the entirety of your screens.
# The problem here is that with xinerama, it's only going to tell you the
# x/y/width/height of each screen, and the window manager isn't much more
# help. (Especially since they aren't required to broadcast their struts
# or partial struts, to my knowledge. If I had that information, I might be
# able to eliminate this configuration.)
#
# The configuration is pretty straight-forward. See the commented out example
# for a sample. (Which will create even margins around the tiling windows
# for two screens. It's actually kind of neat looking. Try it.)
#
# Note: If you have this set and you only have one screen, it will override
# the workarea reported by your window manager.
Config.WORKAREA = {}

# Pretty straight forward here. Just use the screen number as your key,
# (starting from zero) and specify *all four* of the configuration 
# options: top, bottom, left, and right. Each value should be the number 
# of pixels from the edge of the screen that PyTyle should ignore.
#Config.WORKAREA = {                   
#                   0: {
#                       'top': 100,
#                       'bottom': 100,
#                       'left': 100,
#                       'right': 100,
#                       },
#                   1: {
#                       'top': 200,
#                       'bottom': 200,
#                       'left': 200,
#                       'right': 200,
#                       }, 
#                   }


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IGNORE WINDOW LIST
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is a simple list of windows that PyTyle should exclude from
# tiling. It's case-insensitive and will search the name and class
# of the window. (This search algorithm could change, as I haven't 
# put much thought into it.)
#
# Note: This is useful for things like run dialogs and other quick
# popups that PyTyle can't detect. (It will, however, detect popups
# within other windows.) Also useful for applications like Gimp.
#
# Note 2: You shouldn't need to put dmenu here.
Config.FILTER = [
               'gmrun', 'gimp', 'download',

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TILING PER WORKSPACE/SCREEN
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This will let you configure the default tiling algorithms on a
# per screen per workspace basis. A default tiler must be set.
# Also, see the commented out configuration for an example.
#
# Remember: You can always cycle through the different tiling
# algorithms after the initial tile.

               }

# This configuration sets the default tiler to "Vertical", and the
# default tiler of Screen 1 to "Horizontal" (so all desktops on
# Screen 1 will have a horizontal layout at first). Also, this will
# set the default layout on Screen 0 for desktops 4 and 6 to
# "Horizontal".
#
# Note: Screen and desktop numbers start from 0. So desktop 4 should
# be configured using "3" below.
